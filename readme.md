# Dart

Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language optimized for building fast and scalable applications. It is primarily used for developing mobile, web, and desktop applications, with Flutter being its most popular framework.

## Key Features
- **Fast**: Compiles to native code for high performance.
- **Flexible**: Supports both just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
- **Productive**: Easy-to-read syntax and a rich set of libraries.
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run anywhere.

## Getting Started
1. Install Dart from the [official website](https://dart.dev/).
2. Create your first program:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     print('Hello, Dart!');
   }
